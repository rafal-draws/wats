# Web Application Testing Simplified


## Technologies used:
üêç Python 3.11

üå∂Ô∏è Flask (backend)

‚úÖ Selenium (test execution)

ü•¥ JavaScript



## The idea
As I was supporting several services, there was a hint provided by one of our clients for us to provide some testing. 
These tests would happen every so often on services updates, but aside regresssion testing that clients wanted when 
new versions were arriving, I wanted to simplify that process.

Therefore, I came up with an idea of a service that would work in similar fashion to Jenkins (hosted a service on the machine).
Users of any sort (appliaction owners, support specialists/engineers, manual testers, automation test engineers even) will be able to use the application
with basic XPATH knowledge, or with basic web browser developers tool know-how. 



We used Flask for it's wonderful Jinja templates engine, ORM that fulfilled our need, and Selenium for whole test execution engine.

I created the app, it's test creation module, test execution module, database modeling and overall logic and architecture.

It wouldn't be as beautiful as it is now without terrific visual retouch by Paulina, co-author of our Engineer's thesis.
